Software application created by Kirk Harland and members of the MASS research group at the University of Leeds.  The initial release of this software contains a module using the Simulated Annealing algorithm for static spatial microsimuation.

For more information, see the [MASS Website](http://mass.leeds.ac.uk/html/coding/fmf/intro/index.html) and a [user guide](http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3177/) explaining how it works.
