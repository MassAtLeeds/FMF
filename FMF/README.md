In the src directory all of the source files required to build the project can be found in the correct directory structures reflecting the relevant classpaths. The software has dependencies on third party software:
<ul>  
   <li> beansbinding-1.2.1</li>
   <li>colt</li>
   <li>derby</li>
   <li>derbyclient</li>
   <li>derbynet</li>
   <li>ec_util</li>
   <li>opencsv-2.3</li>
   <li>swing-layout-1.0.3</li>
</ul>
The associated jar files for these dependencies can be found in the Dependancies directory.

The test data directory contains a very simplified idealised example set of data.  This example is included so that users can see the file structures required to create a model.
