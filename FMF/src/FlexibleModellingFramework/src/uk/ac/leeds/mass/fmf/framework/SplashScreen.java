/**
 * <p>
 * This is the class to create the splash screen while the rest of the application loads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is a singleton as only one splash screen should be used.  The current instance
 * of the instantiated object can be retrieved by calling the method getSplashScreen.
 * Some of the methods in this class are synchronized because the main thread passes
 * through and initialises the load, but also threads created in the JVM to observe 
 * the loading of the image pass through these methods, therefore it is safest to synchronize
 * the methods to make sure that the internal variables are in the correct state at 
 * the right point in time. The design of this class was inspired by the 
 * example given by Roy Ratcliffe at <br> <b>http://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/javasplash/Java%20Splash%20Screen.pdf</b><br>
 * although it has some significant differences in it internal working.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To create and display a splash screen the following example code can be used:<br><br>
 *         
 *       //Load the splash screen<br>
 *       SplashScreen splash = SplashScreen.getSplashScreen("Splash.jpg");<br><br>
 *
 *       //if you want the application loading to wait for the splash screen to load<br>
 *       //this method can be called but this is optional.  Note that if a problem is<br> 
 *       //encountered loading the splash screen the main loading thread will not wait.<br>
 *       splash.waitForSplashScreen();<br><br>
 *       
 *       //code to load the main application<br><br>
 * 
 *       //while loading the application the static method  setStatus can be used<br>
 *       //to display messages indicating the load progress to the screen.<br>
 *       SplashScreen.setStatus(progressMessage);<br><br>
 * 
 *       //set the main application screen visible<br><br>
 * 
 *       //dispose of the splash screen<br>
 *       splash.dispose();<br><br>
 * 
 * It is important that the splash screen is disposed of after the application has 
 * loaded to make sure that resources are released. SplashScreen does not use any 
 * Swing components to minimise in the overheads of loading the splash screen up.
 * </p>
