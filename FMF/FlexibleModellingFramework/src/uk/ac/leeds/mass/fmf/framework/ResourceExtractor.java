 * <p>
 * This class is a singleton and provides the methods for extracting all of the 
 * information contained in the application .jar files.
 * </p>
 * <p><b>IT DOES NOT PROVIDE METHODS FOR READING/WRITING OR FINDING FILES</b></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The ResourceExtractor is mainly used in two ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The first use is during the class loading process. As the module menus are 
 * loaded during the initial start, up each class in each jar file in the directories
 * and sub-directories in the application class-path and the locations 
 * specified in the Init.txt are extracted by the ResourceExtractor and placed in
 * local storage.  These locally stored classes can be loaded up from the local storage
 * by the class loader GenericClassLoader.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The second use is to interogate .jar files to locate resources required by any of
 * loaded modules.  This process is also used to load the splash screen on application
 * startup.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
